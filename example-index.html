      <p>
        The Shiba Inu is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog from Japan.
        A small, agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally
        bred for hunting.

      <p class="more-info">
          Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West
          and are already the most popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring
          (red, red sesame, or black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike.
          They’re sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.

        The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky’s almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue and sometimes
        one of each—and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression.
        Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait.
      </p>
      <p class="more-info">
          As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs.
          The Sibe’s innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs.
          These are energetic dogs who can’t resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must.
          An attractive feature of the breed: Huskies are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.

      <p>
        The Pug’s motto is the Latin phrase “multum in parvo” (a lot in a little) an apt description of this
        small but muscular breed. They come in three colors: silver or apricot-fawn with a black face mask, or all black.
        The large round head, the big, sparkling eyes, and the wrinkled brow give Pugs a range of human-like expressions;
        surprise, happiness, curiosity—that have delighted owners for centuries.
      </p>
      <p class="more-info">
        Pug owners say their breed is the ideal house dog. Pugs are happy in the city or country, with kids or old folks,
        as an only pet or in a pack. They enjoy their food, and care must be taken to keep them trim.
        They do best in moderate climates—not too hot, not too cold—but, with proper care, Pugs can be their adorable selves anywhere.
